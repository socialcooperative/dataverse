# Dataverse #

Dataverse is a user-friendly tool for creating conversational forms which store their data in dynamic databases.


### How do I get set up? ###

You can use the Dockerfile to get started, especially for development.
Create a directory called /custom/ at the base, and copy the /config/secrets.php to /custom/secrets.php and make appropriate edits.
You can use MySQL (recommended), Postgres, or SQLite. The tables/schema will be created on the fly.

### Who do I talk to? ###
